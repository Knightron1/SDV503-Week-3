# SDV503-Week-3
What have I learnt?
I have gained additional insight in to how increments and decrements work as well as how java reads expressions. An understanding of how pre-increments and post-increments work was also gained. Furthermore we learned how to use a 'for' loop.

Why have I learned this?
This was part of the required learning, but more importantly this gave me an understanding of the subtleties of java operation.

How have I learned this?
By experimenting with code and seeing how java solves expressions arrayed before I've learned that Java reads everything from left to right and this affects how it solves expressions.
